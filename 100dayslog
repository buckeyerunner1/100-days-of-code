# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Brief Intro and Commentary** I've spent Days 1-8 going back through FCC after starting it back in August 2017 and stalling out at the
first project. I found life getting busy and put teaching myself to code on the backburner. It wasn't until I was off for 2 weeks from work
over the holidays that I stumbled upon a Medium article about the #100daysofcode challenge. I decided that I'd start and I did so on Jan.
2, 2018. I was diligent about getting at least an hour of coding in per day. Then on or around day 10, my youngest daughter got a bad viral
infection in her lungs that required several nights in the hospital. This was my second derail on teaching myself to code. So in March, I
decided to start fresh. I'm currently on day 9. Now, I didn't always give up teaching myself cold turkey when the derails came. I am an
active member of the Reddit /r/learntoprogram and read several articles daily on either Medium or through my Google feed about developing 
from front end to back end and everything in between.
