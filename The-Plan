**The Start of a Plan**
    **04.24.18**
     So I need to come up with a plan of coursework to teach myself to code. I've started with FCC, currently on lesson 101, 
     but as I read additional resources on Medium and Reddit, I feel drawn to either signing up for an actual course with 
     deadlines and such that will help me get on track (Udacity) or to take the highly touted CS50 course on edX.
