## Log

### R1D1 
I spent the majority of my time focusing on the installing and setting up my Virtual Machine with a Linux (Ubuntu) installation. 

### R1D2
Night 2 I started the Installfest for the start of the Web Developer portion of The Odin Project: Rails, RVM, Ruby, etc. I also set up Git and created my SSH key to connect my Heroku and Github accounts. Once it was created though, I was unable to find the folder on the VM in my /home/pstoicoiu/ folder. I should have been able to see the /home/pstoicoiu/.ssh folder, but for the life of me I couldn't access it and it was not visible, but the terminal kept saying I had a key installed. I gave up after too long and went to bed. 

### R1D3
After Googling terminal commands to copy and paste my SSH key, since I still couldn't see it, I managed to find a command to open the file location instead. This magically made it appear in the folder too so that I could finally open it and copy the key. I continued my setup until it was complete and stopped at the step where you create a sample rails app to show the installations were a success. 

## R1D4
I wish I could say I did some actual coding today. I had every intention to. Instead, I spent much of my time configuring my new Netgear router (R8000P). It wasn't all just plug and play to start off though. I ended up having to change the SSID and password. I did managed to read a little about some newbie coders over on Medium. I finally ended the day logging into my VM and started the Ruby sample app project to test the installations. 

## R1D5
Oh baby that was fun today. I test my ruby and rails installations and pushed the test app to heroku, where I actually got to see it deployed! I know I was just following instructions, but the fact that I was able to do it and see something go from start to finish was awesome. If it wasn't for the fact that I'm tired, I'd keep going with another lesson. But alas, there will be tomorrow! 

## R1D6
Started the "Git Basics" section on @theodinprject. Read a chapter on version control and the history of Git, watched a few Youtube videos on Git and Github and saw enough redudant material to drill in my head! Tomorrow, I practice with some Git Basics in Terminal!

## R1D7
One week in the books! Tonight was a bit different than my previous nights. I spent much of my evening working on the website I maintain for our town's youth sports. I made a Google Form for our baseball/softball registration. I was then able to embed it into our website. take a look for yourself and leave me feedback! http://bit.ly/2AHVSv3
