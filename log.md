# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Brief Intro and Commentary** I've spent Days 1-8 going back through FCC after starting it back in August 2017 and stalling out at the
first project. I found life getting busy and put teaching myself to code on the backburner. It wasn't until I was off for 2 weeks from work
over the holidays that I stumbled upon a Medium article about the #100daysofcode challenge. I decided that I'd start and I did so on Jan.
2, 2018. I was diligent about getting at least an hour of coding in per day. Then on or around day 10, my youngest daughter got a bad viral
infection in her lungs that required several nights in the hospital. This was my second derail on teaching myself to code. So in March, I
decided to start fresh. I'm currently on day 9. Now, I didn't always give up teaching myself cold turkey when the derails came. I am an
active member of the Reddit /r/learntoprogram and read several articles daily on either Medium or through my Google feed about developing 
from front end to back end and everything in between. After back and forth on how to get started again, I deleted my previous FCC account
and started fresh from the beginning. This time, I'm going to finish. 

### Round 1, Day 9: April 2, 2018

**Today's Activities**: Where to start. After reading several articles, reading reddit and talking to some fellow employees in the 
software development field (I am in Accounting/Control), I realized that in order for me to make it through the full 100+ days, I need
to have a plan to go along with my goal. I started out on FCC months back then decided to start The Odin Project, so aside from keeping 
my daily log, I'm also creating an outline of what my self-teaching plan will look like to keep me on track. There will be some fluidity
to the plan so that I can change directions/programs on the fly, should something come up.
